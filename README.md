The NeoRoo app connects the NeoWarm sensor and provides real-time updates to nurses and caregivers about kangaroo mother care metrics.

Every year, approximately 15 million premature babies are born and face a higher risk of newborn mortality, particularly in low and middle-income countries. One common complication of prematurity is neonatal hypothermia, which can be effectively treated with Kangaroo Mother Care/Skin-to-Skin care (KMC/STS). However, implementing KMC/STS is hindered by multiple barriers such as a shortage of healthcare workers and the labor-intensive nature of caring for premature newborns, leading to inconsistent scale-up of KMC/STS.

To address these challenges, a sensor-enabled swaddling device (NeoWarm) and the linked NeoRoo mobile app 64 have been developed to support the adoption and uptake of skin-to-skin care among adult-baby dyads and automatically collect key vital signs information from newborns. The goals of this technology include automated monitoring of vital signs with regular alerts to parents and nurses if any abnormality is detected, enabling nurses to track multiple babies and KMC dyads simultaneously, and setting and tracking shared goals for education, KMC, and discharge. The ultimate aim of understanding whether this device is feasible and acceptable for use in health facilities in the United States. The future directions of this technology include incorporating participatory design feedback, conducting A/B usability assessments, and modifying and evaluating the feasibility for opioid-exposed infants.

The participatory design study with A/B prototypes of the app is being conducted. This project is to perform enhancements to the NeoRoo app based on the appâ€™s feedback.
